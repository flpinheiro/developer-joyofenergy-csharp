Story #2345 - Display Cost of Last Week's Usage
Ready for Dev

Description  Edit

As an electricity consumer I want to be able to view my usage cost of the last week so that I can monitor my spending
Acceptance Criteria:

* Given I have a smart meter ID with price plan attached to it and usage data stored, when I request the usage cost then I am shown the correct cost of last week's usage
* Given I have a smart meter ID without a price plan attached to it and usage data stored, when I request the usage cost then an error message is displayed

How to calculate usage cost

* Unit of meter readings : kW (KiloWatt)
* Unit of Time : Hour (h)
* Unit of Energy Consumed : kW * Hour = kWh
* Unit of Tariff : $ per kWh (ex 0.2 $ per kWh)

To calculate the usage cost for a duration (D) in which lets assume we have captured N electricity readings (er1,er2,er3....erN)
Average reading in KW = (er1.reading + er2.reading + ..... erN.Reading)/N
Usage time in hours = Duration(D) in hours
Energy consumed in kWh = average reading * usage time
Cost = tariff unit prices * energy consumed
